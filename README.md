# lobster-python

## Objective
The goal of this project was to conduct an exploratory analysis of Maine's fisheries, focusing mostly on factors influencing the price of lobster. 

## Data
Open source catch data by fishing port from 2008-2022 was sourced from the [Maine Department of Marine Resources Landings Dashboard]( 
https://mainedmr.shinyapps.io/Landings_Portal/).

Maine county map GeoJSON file is from the geographical repository maintained by [OpenDataSoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/georef-united-states-of-america-county/information/?disjunctive.ste_code&disjunctive.ste_name&disjunctive.coty_code&disjunctive.coty_name&sort=year). 

Lobster producer price index data was sourced from the [Federal Reserve of Economic data website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU02230503). 

## Tools
Analysis was conducted using Jupiter notebooks, Anaconda libraries manager, and Python (with pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, folium, and sklearn libraries).

## Visualizations
Project dashboard is available on Tableau Public via this link. The time series analysis and correlation matrix were not included in this storyboard.
